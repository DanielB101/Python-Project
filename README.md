# Python-Project

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns and customer base. 

For this project, the goal was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on existing customer data and their purchasing behavior in their database to inform their marketing strategy to help Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
